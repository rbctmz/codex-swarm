# T-063: Add Garmin MCP analyst agent

## Goal

- Build the GARMIN_ANALYST agent so the swarm can interpret Garmin MCP telemetry (training load, recovery status, sleep quality, and readiness) and recommend follow-ups without leaving the local Codex workflow.

## Scope

- - Add `.AGENTS/GARMIN_ANALYST.json` describing inputs (task context + MCP exports), outputs (metric summaries + action plan), permissions, and a workflow that references `@docs/workflow/T-063.md` and `python3 scripts/agentctl.py`.
- - Update `AGENTS.md` so the registry notes when to invoke this specialist, pointing to T-063 as the originating request.
- - Keep the first commit focused on planning, the second on the implementation artifacts, and the third on the verification notes (this file).

## Verification

- - Confirm `.AGENTS/GARMIN_ANALYST.json` exists and follows the format expected by the registry.
- - Ensure `AGENTS.md` now mentions the new agent in the “Current JSON Agents” section.
- - Make sure future work references this doc and that commands run through `python3 scripts/agentctl.py`.
