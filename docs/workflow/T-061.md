# T-061: Require user approval before final task-closing commit

## Goal

Ensure agents always request explicit user confirmation before creating the final closure commit for a task (the commit that marks the task DONE in `tasks.json`, typically alongside `docs/workflow/T-###.md` updates).

## Scope

- Update `AGENTS.md` global workflow rules.
- Update `.AGENTS/REVIEWER.json` and ORCHESTRATOR guidance to enforce a pause for user approval before closure.

## Verification

- `python scripts/agentctl.py task lint`
- `python scripts/agentctl.py agents`

## Implementation Notes

- Updated `AGENTS.md` COMMIT_WORKFLOW + ORCHESTRATOR execution guidance to require explicit user approval before the final task-closing commit.
- Updated `.AGENTS/REVIEWER.json` to prompt for user approval before running `agentctl finish` + committing `tasks.json` (and workflow artifacts).
