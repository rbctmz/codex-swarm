# T-064: Analyze 7-day Garmin MCP telemetry

## Goal

- Use the GARMIN_ANALYST flow to turn the MCP exports in `@data/garmin/` into a concise briefing about training load, recovery trends, sleep quality, and readiness for the seven-day window that ends 2025-12-20.

## Scope

- Inspect `@data/garmin/training.json`, `@data/garmin/recovery.json`, `@data/garmin/sleep.json`, and `@data/garmin/readiness.json` to summarize totals, trends, and anomalies (load spikes, HRV shifts, poor sleep, readiness drops).
- Note when data shows unbalanced recovery (e.g., 2025-12-18) and propose follow-up actions for CODER/DOCS/REVIEWER such as scheduling light sessions, improving sleep habits, or documenting rest-day rationale.
- Keep all references Codex-friendly by citing the source files with `@` syntax and describing how metrics were derived without storing secrets.

## Verification

- Confirm each summary statement can be traced to the named Garmin export using the `@data/garmin/*.json` paths.
- Ensure no extra commands were required beyond reviewing the JSON payloads.
- Leave the real-world decision points in this doc so the next agent knows what to follow up on (e.g., hold hard workouts after 2025-12-18, monitor HRV the next two mornings).
