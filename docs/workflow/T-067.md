# T-067 — Garmin Data Refresh + Weekly Plan Update (29 Dec–4 Jan)

Status: TODO → DOING → DONE
Owner: human
Priority: med

## Goal
Refresh Garmin metrics for week 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-28 and update weekly training plan accordingly.

## Deliverables
- Updated JSON data in `data/garmin/readiness.json`, `data/garmin/recovery.json`, `data/garmin/sleep.json`, `data/garmin/training.json`.
- Refreshed coaching plan in `docs/coaching/2025-12-28-training-plan.md` with latest metrics and timestamp.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New data range reflects 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-28 (weekly metrics, HRV status, sleeps, steps, intensity minutes).
- Plan remains conservative for holiday week with dynamic checkpoints intact.
- Commit workflow follows the 3-step cadence (planning, implementation, closure) with guard checks.

## Notes
- Source: Garmin Connect snapshot and weekly metrics (HRV/status, sleeps, steps, intensity), most recent VO2Max.
- Training status: RECOVERY; ACWR ~0.7 LOW; Aerobic High shortage persists; Anaerobic remains below target.

## Implementation Summary (to be filled on closure)
 - Updated files:
	 - `data/garmin/readiness.json`: refreshed metadata (collected_at, date_range), training status (RECOVERY since 2025-12-28), training load balance, ACWR (acute 246, chronic 322, ratio 0.7), VO2Max (run 43 on 2025-12-26; bike 36 on 2025-12-24).
	 - `data/garmin/recovery.json`: added HRV daily statuses 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-28 (UNBALANCED → BALANCED trend). 
	 - `data/garmin/sleep.json`: appended nightly sleeps for 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-28 with durations and scores.
	 - `data/garmin/training.json`: added daily intensity minutes and steps for 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-27; weekly trends for week ending 2025-12-29.
	  - `docs/coaching/2025-12-28-training-plan.md`: updated data timestamp and key metrics (ACWR 0.7 LOW, HRV last night 39 ms BALANCED, Aerobic High 475, Anaerobic 52, sleep 9h19m, BB morning 97) and rewrote "Previous Week Analysis (21–27 Dec)" with actual insights based on 22–27 Dec metrics (steps 62,077; intensity 368; HRV trend recovered to BALANCED; sleep improved on 27→28 Dec).
 - Plan kept conservative due to holiday week and RECOVERY status; dynamic checkpoints maintained.
