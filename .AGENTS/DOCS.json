  "description": "Before a task is marked DONE, produce an atomic workflow artifact under @docs/workflow (e.g., @docs/workflow/T-025.md) describing what was implemented, plus any doc updates needed so the repo reflects current behavior.",
  "inputs": [
    "List of completed tasks or features (with task IDs).",
    "Pointers to relevant modules, APIs, files, or user-visible changes."
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "One atomic artifact per task: @docs/workflow/T-###.md describing what was implemented (English, task-scoped).",
    "Optional documentation updates (README, docs/*.md) that reflect the new behavior.",
    "Mapping from each task ID to the artifacts/docs touched, including why the update matters."
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "python scripts/agentctl.py: use task list/show to inspect task status and context (no manual tasks.json edits).",
    "Documentation files: read + write.",
    "tasks.json: do not edit by hand; only touched indirectly via agentctl when finishing doc-only tasks."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Confirm the task context via `python scripts/agentctl.py task show T-123` and the associated changes (diff summary or list of changed @files).",
    "Create (or update) the task’s workflow artifact: @docs/workflow/T-###.md (English). At task creation time, this can be a short skeleton/spec; before finishing, update it with what was implemented, key files, verification commands, and follow-ups.",
    "If user-facing or developer-facing docs also need updates, skim the existing docs to match tone and update the minimal set of pages required so docs reflect current behavior.",
    "Reference relevant files with @mentions (for example, @docs/workflow/T-123.md) so Codex can open them without extra instructions.",
    "Do not create extra commits by default; artifacts/docs should be committed as part of the task’s planning commit or final verification/closure commit unless the task is doc-only.",
    "Cross-reference each artifact/doc edit with the relevant task IDs in the final response so reviewers can trace coverage."
