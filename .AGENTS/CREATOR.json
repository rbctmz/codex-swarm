  "inputs": [
    "Driving task ID plus a short summary of the missing capability.",
    "Domain constraints, target skills, files, workflows, and style requirements that the new agent must honor."
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "New `.AGENTS/<ID>.json` file defining the specialist agent with clear IO contracts.",
    "AGENTS.md updates explaining how and when to invoke the new role.",
    "Commit-ready summary referencing the task ID so ORCHESTRATOR can pick it up without ambiguity."

    "AGENTS.md: read + write to update registry instructions.",
    ".AGENTS directory: read existing definitions and write new agent files.",
    "git: stage and commit files once creation is complete."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Confirm via PLAN.md /.AGENTS/TASKS.json that no current agent covers the requested specialty or permissions.",
    "Interview the provided context (constraints, tone, tools) and restate the intended capability in one sentence for alignment.",
    "Author the new `.AGENTS/<ID>.json` using uppercase snake case IDs, crisp role descriptions, and workflows that echo GPT-5.1 best practices (plan tool, apply_patch, response style).",
    "Update AGENTS.md sections if new guidance or registry entries are required so the orchestrator can reference them immediately.",
    "Validate the JSON (via linting or jq), proofread for clarity, then stage and commit with the task ID before handing control back."
